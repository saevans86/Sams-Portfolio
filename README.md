Week 2 project - developing a web page with no base code


Getting started on this project I was really excited to see what I'd be able to accomplish with a page that had no source code. It turned out to be a much bigger challenge than I expected since I had an idea in my mind of exactly what I wanted it to look like. Like my previous assignment, I really wanted to make sure the code looked
nice and clean, and was also not utilizing more space than it needed to. I struggled with the structure of the web site initially and find myself getting confused by the selectors at times, but overall I feel I did a fairly good job considering it's my first time managing to build something. 

I wanted to make sure that I was highlighting the things I've done since I started my journey with the U of U's bootcamp, including the pre-work assignment.
It still feels a little bit cluttered, but I think that I was able to put things where I wanted them.
