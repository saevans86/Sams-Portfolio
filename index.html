    <h4> Password Gnerator </h4>
<p>
My most recent project was to create a password generator from a base code that included 8-128 characters, uppercase, lowercase, symbols and numbers.

<p> In our first week assignment we were given a base code to refactor the existing page by simplifying the
code while keeping the general appearance and functionality of the page the same.</p>

    <p>
    I have been working in the medical field in different areas for a little over 13 years.
    I have always been interesting developing and coding since I started gaming as
    kid, always being intruiged with what is happening behind the scenes and I really feel like it's time for a change in pace!
    </p>
    <p>Since starting The U of U's coding bootcamp, I've realized my brain enjoys the
    challenge of the analytical aspect of coding, which keeps me engaged. I like to set blocks of
    time aside to make sure I can be fully present with anything I'm currentnly working on.
    </p>
    <p>
    I'm exciting to see more of what I can accomplish while working through the projects and assignments.
