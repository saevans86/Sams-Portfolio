      <p>Hi, I am Sam, Salt Lake City goof-ball - I love live music and animals ü¶ù</p>

      <p>
        I have been working in the medical field in different areas for a little over 13 years.
        I have always been interesting developing and coding since I started gaming as
        kid, always being intruiged with what is happening behind the scenes and I really feel like it's time for a change in pace!
      </p>
      <p>Since starting The U of U's coding bootcamp, I've realized my brain enjoys the
        challenge of the analytical aspect of coding, which keeps me engaged. I like to set blocks of
        time aside to make sure I can be fully present with anything I'm currentnly working on.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm exciting to see more of what I can accomplish while working through the projects and assignments.
